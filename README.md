# API-Documentation

This is a documentation that introduces researchers some useful APIs to download resources from [UMedia](https://umedia.lib.umn.edu/), which provides open access to digitized materials from across the University of Minnesota. This documentation has three parts: 

..* Formatting the URLs for downloading texts. 

..* Formatting the URLs for downloading still images. 

..* A Jupyter file to illustrate the use of APIs to download the texts or objects based on the URLs formatted in the previous steps. This file introduces three useful modules, json, shutil, and requests. It also briefly talks about the data structures used to stroe the downloaded objects and the basic I/O mechanism to export the downloaded content into the local machine.
